# Frick-ZyBooks
Me and my homies hate zybooks.

## what is it?

A chrome extension that solves most problems in ZyBooks. 
I Only developed and tested this for the book I have access to, but the code should be pretty readable and easy to add new functionality.

Feel free to email me with questions, I am no longer working on this project, but will still fix any bugs that get reported

I have the CS10B book so this probably wont work with any other book.
The code tracing question solver assumes the language is in C++, but if you have a different language or book,
it should be pretty easy to change or add a new problem type. the Code is meant to be pretty modular.


# instructions:
save to a folder named "frick-zybooks"

in chrome, go to "chrome://extensions/"

click load unpacked.

select the folder called "frick-zybooks"

clcik the little badge next to the problem set title to solve it automatically. (sometimes you need to reload, idk why and honest I don't care)

Problems with code tracing will require you to sign up for an API, but its free and I have received no spam.
you can find instructions and a place to put the key in the extension options.
