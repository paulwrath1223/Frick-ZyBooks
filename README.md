# Frick-ZyBooks
Me and my homies hate zybooks

Feel free to email me with questions, I am working on this project daily (as of 8/26/23)

I have the CS10B book so this probably wont work with any other book.
The code tracing problems assume the language is in C++, but if you have a different language or book,
it should be pretty easy to add a new problem type. the Code is meant to be pretty modular.


# instructions:
save to a folder named "frick-zybooks"

in chrome, go to "chrome://extensions/"

click load unpacked.

select the folder called "frick-zybooks"

clcik the little badge next to the problem set title to solve it automatically.

Problems with code tracing will require you to sign up for an API, but its free and I have received no spam.
you can find instructions and a place to put the key in the extension options.
